# OSM 

OSM is a groovy module based on the OrbisData module to extract, load and transform OSM data to GIS layers.

Users can obtain GIS layers from two approaches :  Advanced or Template 


### Advanded approach 

The advanced approach chains a set of processes to extract a OSM xml file from an overpass query, load the file into a spatial database (PostGIS or H2GIS) and then tranform it into a set of layers (points, lines or polygons).

### Template approach

The template approach proposes a set of pre-configured overpass queries to build thematic GIS layers :  BUILDING, LANDCOVER and WATER. For each processing templates, the 3 dimensions, point, line and polygon can be extracted.
